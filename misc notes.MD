## Post Mortem Notes
### Stone Tao
* Focus on infrastructure first
### Java Best Waifu  
* Most important factors are "Simplicity, Robustness and Structured Code." 
* "Usually the bots that perform the best are those that perform the basics really well (navigation, communication, micro, macro, etc.)."
* "Also, if the code undergoes drastic changes (for instance because you change the bot’s main strategy) I would suggest to do a bot from scratch."

### The High Ground
* Their main point is to copy the strategies of the best teams and focus on implementing them yourself rather than coming up with your own code. This seems very appealing because we could just notice early on copy the strategy of the best team in the sprint tourney and then just focus on implementing it. Hopefully this gives us an advantage in the high school bracket. 
* "The first week and a half-ish of Battlecode should be mostly focused on writing code which won’t change if your strategy changes. For example, navigation, resource-gathering, and communication."
